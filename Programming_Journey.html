        <h3>Some Things I've Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <p1>My programming journey has taken me all over the place. I started learning C++ because I wanted to build video games.
                <p1>Then, I realized that I also thought Cybersecurity was awesome, so I decided to switch majors and started learning Python.
                    <p1>Eventually, I discovered web development and fell in love with creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        <p1>I have also dabbled in other languages like JavaScript so I can learn website functionality and Kotlin for Android development.
                            <p1>The more I learn about programming, the more I realize how interconnected everything is.
                                <p1>Each project I work on teaches me something new, whether it's about coding, design, or problem-solving.
                                    <p1>I'm excited to continue this journey and see where it takes me next.
                                        <p1>I am also excited to get into back-end development and learn more about server-side programming.
                                            <p1>Ultimately, I want to become a well-rounded developer who can work on all aspects of a project.
                                        </p1>
                                    </p1>
                                </p1>
                            </p1>
                        </p1>
                    </p1>
                </p1>
            </p1>
        </ul>
        <h4>Text-Based-Game</h4>
        <ul>
            
            <p2>I also made a text-based adventure game in Python for one of my classes in school.</p2>
            <p2>It's a simple game where you can explore different rooms, collect items, and solve puzzles.</p2>
            <p2><br>It was a fun project that helped me practice my Python skills and learn about game design.</p2>            
            <p2><br>Check out the code and give the game a try here:</p2>
